The proposed project will contribute to two strategic objectives of the Biodiversity Strategy for GEF-5, namely: a) improve the sustainability of Protected Areas (PA) systems; and b) mainstream biodiversity conservation and sustainable use into production landscapes/ seascapes and sectors. The threats that the Project seeks to address are aligned with this strategy. The project is made up of the following four components: (1) Sustainable Management of Protected Areas. This component will improve management effectiveness and long term sustainability of the Project PAs with a focus on financial sustainability, monitoring of biodiversity, and monitoring and evaluation of the Project. This goal will rest on three interdependent areas of intervention: alliances for participatory management, biodiversity monitoring, and endowment fund. (2) Biodiversity and Sustainable Productive Landscapes. This component will mainstream biodiversity and sustainable production in PAs and Buffer Zones. It focuses on three areas of intervention: Biodiversity-friendly production systems, Strengthening of Community-based organizations (CBOs), and Municipal environmental subprojects. (3) Knowledge Management, Training and Communications. This component will develop and implement: (i) a communication and outreach strategy for dissemination of information on the Project and promotion of partnerships for the management of PAs; (ii) an awareness and fundraising campaign for the endowment fund; and (iii) an educational campaign addressed to consumers on biodiversity-friendly products and the economic value of biodiversity. It will focus on the following three areas of intervention: Knowledge management, South-South cooperation and promotion of partnerships, and Strategic communication and outreach.

The development objective of the COMACO Landscape Project is to reduce emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) through the sustainable management within 270,698 ha of land traditionally devoted to community led agricultural and non-agricultural activities. The delivery of the ERs according to the delivery schedule agreed upon in the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) is the results indicator that is being monitored by the World Bank over the ERPA duration.<br />

 2. The project has the following specifictechnical objectives: (a) Agriculture Land Management including Agroforestry: to increase food production and household income by expanding legume-based agroforestry systems with demonstrated higher sustainable crop yields, and production of important firewood, materials and tradable carbon compared to thebaseline of traditional smallholder agriculture; (b) Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD): More specifically the Project will promote sustainable climate-smart agricultural practices in selected chiefdoms in the Eastern Province of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ). The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices will increase small-holder farmer crop yield, farmer income and welfare, reduce uncontrolled forest loss and degradation, which would be supported inthe short term by carbon revenues received from a significant increase in bio-carbon sequestration in agricultural areas and avoided emissions in forested areas. 
 

  To protect and expand areas under natural forest and conserve biodiversity through the intensification of food production on existing farm plots by adoption of legume-based agroforestry with in-built firewood production and avoidance of fallows, which will replace the need for further forest clearing as part of slash and burn agriculture, firewood and charcoal production.

Under this program of support, the woredas are responsible for the delivery of basic education, primary health care, agriculture extension, water supply, and rural road maintenance. The government’s overall program of support is reflected in the current growth and transformation plan (GTP), which includes broad objectives for service delivery in each sector. The GTP aims to expand the coverage of basic services and improve their quality as a key mechanism to achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs). The PforR will prioritize local-level financing for education, health, and agriculture. The PforR beneficiaries are the whole population benefiting from basic service delivery, particularly the bottom 20 percent of income groups and most poorly performing woredas.

Participation in the two proposed budget support operations for the APEI is linked to readiness criteria (outlined below), which only three countries (Mauritius, Mozambique, and Seychelles) currently meet. The first operation in the proposed programmatic series will therefore be for a proposed credit equivalent to US$10 million for Mozambique, and proposed loans (equivalent to US$14.9 million and US$5 million for Mauritius and Seychelles, respectively). The same readiness criteria will be used for all five countries when preparing the second DPO to assess if they are eligible to participate in the second operation. It is expected that all five countries that are members of APEI will participate at that point. Hence, the programmatic series is aligned with the membership in the APEI, its strategic orientation, and the initiative’s initial time frame, with the second operation planned for Board presentation in FY17. The operation focuses on these pillars because the reforms in these three pillars are more likely to have positive spillovers to neighboring countries. Therefore, coordinated implementation of reforms is expected to increase the overall returns to the reforms that each country undertakes. As a result, these reforms are more likely to be implemented, and will have larger economic impacts, if addressed in parallel, because countries benefit from their own reforms and also from the reforms in neighboring countries. The programmatic approach permits continued support over time to allow sequencing and deepening of complex reforms, and to support all five countries through the second operation if readiness criteria permit. In short, consistency of reforms and credible regional coordination can help change the political economy of domestic debate and also increase pressure for complementary domestic reforms."

Morocco has begun developing an integrated DRM reform program, which combines elements of institutional reform with risk reduction investments and risk insurance to ensure that residual risks that cannot be cost-effectively mitigated are efficiently financed. The Government program consists of the consolidation and further development of Morocco’s risk management activities and specifically aims to: (i) improve Morocco’s institutional DRM framework and capacity; (ii) scale up disaster risk reduction investments in both structural and non-structural measures and assure such investments are transparently selected, strategic, and cost effective; and (iii) protect vulnerable populations and economic assets through creation of catastrophic risk insurance and a financial safety net for the most vulnerable who are often not insured. The PforR has been identified as the most appropriate lending instrument for a number of reasons. First, the PforR is an effective instrument to ensure that the Bank’s assistance provides incentives for achievement of concrete results by directly linking Bank disbursements to intended results. In addition, the instrument allows for targeting Bank implementation support, including through the mobilization of technical assistance, on the achievement of these results. Second, the PforR is well suited to support a government program that aims to improve the strategic management of an existing expenditure framework, including through more transparent investment selection processes and better monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Third, the PforR enables the Borrower to use its own systems and focus Bank support on improving their efficiency and effectiveness, including on fiduciary and social and environmental issues."

These challenges strongly manifest themselves in Upper Egypt, a grouping of tengovernorates that lag significantly behind the rest of the country in economic growth,employment generation, connectivity, and access to services. Three key constraints, in particular, contribute to weak economic activity in Upper Egypt and relatively low level of private investment: (a) limited empowerment, effectiveness,and accountability of subnational governorates; (b) continuing low levels of access and quality ofinfrastructure and services for both citizens and businesses; and (c) weak investment climate andthe weakness of economic factors supporting value chain development. The first critical constraint to private-sector-led economic growth in Upper Egypt islimited empowerment, accountability, and effectiveness at the governorate and district level. The second constraint is a relatively low level of access and poor quality ofinfrastructure and services for residents as well as firms. The third key constraint to private-sector-led growth in Upper Egypt is the weakinvestment and business climate, with business owners citing obstacles and delays in obtaining licenses, permits, and serviced land.

The CREDD, the 2015 Systematic Country Diagnosis (SCD) and the FY16‐FY19 Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Mali are all closely aligned. The PRIGSO series supports the policies defined in the CREDD by fostering inclusive growth and supporting pro‐poor decentralized transfers and social protection. This is the first credit in the proposed series, which consists of two single tranche credits. The operation has two development objectives: (i) foster inclusive growth and (ii) support pro-poor decentralized transfers and social protection. The operation supports the first objective through a set of mutually reinforcing reforms that should lead to increased revenue of poor rural households following reforms in the provision of agricultural subsidies, the micro‐finance sector, and the legal and institutional framework of rural land. This objective is also supported by improved maintenance of rural roads, an expansion of the mobile phone network, and increased competition in the telecommunications sector. The second objective is supported by increasing the coverage and reducing the fragmentation of the social protection system and by funding accelerated decentralization. This is an important element of the Peace Agreement as reflected by the commitment to almost double the share of spending by non-central entities (collectivités territoriales) from approximately 16 percent of the budget in 2016 to 30 percent in 2018. As governance remains an area of concern, the Authorities have been notified that good governance is an important prerequisite for the PRIGSO series as is maintaining macro‐economic stability."

The $2million medium-size project (MSP) from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Land Degradation focal area will contribute to increase the climate resilience of Moldova's forest and pasture lands through restoration of degraded lands at community and village level. 
 

 GEF financing will support specificaly afforestation and rehabilitation of forest belts and degraded pastures (LD-1 Program 1) and preparation of integrated and participatory forest/pasture management plans for selected LPAs (LD-3 Program 4). The project will support integrated participatory forest and pasture management planning at the Local Public Authority (LPA) level, as well as investments in afforestation and rehabilitation of community lands and pastures in priority raions (districts) in the central and south regions that are considered to be more vunerable to climate change. The grant will contribute to finance LPA-level landscape mapping (i.e. land use “master plans”) and 10-year operational management plans for approximately 29,000 ha of forest land and pastures that aim at more efficient and sustainable use of these resources. Eligibility criteria for participating LPAs include, among others: willingness to participate, capacity and opportunity for collaboration with neighboring LPAs, and availability of suitable land. Investments in selected LPAs will include restoring approximately 1,000 ha of degraded pastures and 1,500 ha of other degraded communal land, as well as establishing and restoring 1,600 ha of agricultural or riparian shelterbelts. The planning process will be undertaken jointly by ICAS and the LPAs. Technical field work will be contracted to the State Forest Enterprises (SFEs) and/or private sector on a competitive basis.
 

 Improved forest and pasture management practices will provide multiple benefits: improved livelihoods for rural population, carbon sequestration and prevention of further degradation. Without additional grant financing the area covered by afforestation and rehabilitation of forest belts and degraded pastures and the related demonstration effect and uptake of improved land management practices would be significantly reduced. Additionally, increased use of native oak species will replace the use of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), which is an introduced species currently widely used in Moldova.

For the last decade, Vietnam has experienced relatively strong economic growth, with GDP growing at an annual average of around 6.3 percent leading to Vietnam’s graduation into a middle-income country. High growth has been accompanied by rapid urbanization, a rising middle class together with improved access to social and economic benefits and services. The concentration of poverty in Vietnam in rural areas, among ethnic minorities and midland and mountainous areas partly reflect low access to economic opportunities due to low economic integration. Vietnam has achieved impressive gains in many dimensions of gender equality, but the situation for ethnic minority women remains a development challenge. The EM women overall have lower literacy and less working knowledge of Vietnamese language. The burden of low access to water, health services and roads as well as poor child nutrition, falls disproportionately on them as they are primarily responsible for collecting water and taking care of family health. Their active participation in prioritization of social-economic infrastructure and livelihoods options is central to improving their wellbeing. Environmental degradation coupled with vulnerability to the impact of extreme weather events and global climate change are major threats to the short, medium and long-term sustainability of the country’s development. The country is projected to be subjected to more heat stress as its mean temperature and the incidence of hot days are expected to further increase. Higher variability and risks in extreme precipitation as well as higher wind speeds are also projected, thereby increasing exposure and risk of typhoons and flooding in coastal and deltaic areas as well as flashfloods and mudslides in mountainous and hilly areas. Future sea level rise would also expose coastal areas to more storm surges. Nevertheless, these challenges, especially for rural areas, are well understood by the Government, as reflected in the recent Vietnam 2035 report jointly prepared with the World Bank Group. The government is committed to support not only initiatives towards climate resilient agriculture or environment-friendly agriculture and/or livelihoods but to also adapt rural infrastructure quality specifications to address climate variability issues."

This approach also reduces the transaction costs on the GoK, by harmonizing a number of the engagement and procedural aspects of budget support operations. With respect to the actions in the joint matrix, the World Bank provides technical assistance on the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) and telecommunications reform areas, the ADB provides assistance on the contingent liabilities and procurement reform areas as well as on broader SOE monitoring and reform, and MFAT provides assistance on the fisheries reform areas. The Bank, ADB, MFAT and DFAT also work together to provide assistance to Public Utilities Board (PUB). In addition, the Bank collaborates closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and with the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) on macro-fiscal policy and Public Financial Management (PFM) issues."

This operation, in the amount of US$120 million, including US$80 million from the IDA 18 Crisis Response Window, is the first of three Development Policy Financing (DPF) operations in a programmatic series. The program development objective of the DPF is to support the Government of Mongolia in restoring debt sustainability, strengthening the social protection system, and enhancing competitiveness. The economic boom in 2011‐13, fueled by strong mineral exports and foreign direct investment (FDI), and expansionary fiscal policy, left Mongolia highly vulnerable to external shocks. These risks materialized from 2014 onward. With minerals accounting for almost 90 percent of exports, a sharp drop in commodity prices and slower growth in China significantly weakened the external and fiscal positions. The economy also took a major hit from a collapse of foreign investment which had reached over 30 percent of GDP during boom years. Expansionary policies compounded these shocks. Economic policy turned expansionary during the double‐digit growth period despite high inflation and a sharp widening of the current account deficit. Economic policy was loosened further from 2014 in response to the external shocks through fiscal expansion and monetary easing, driven by off‐budget expenditure and quasi‐fiscal lending. The economic stimulus, however, came at the cost of a significant increase in economic vulnerabilities. Government debt has increased almost fourfold since 2011, with the budget deficit reaching 17 percent of GDP in 2016. Mounting pressure on the balance of payments caused a sharp currency depreciation and a significant loss of reserves since 2013. Substantial risks to the balance of payments remain as about US$660 million sovereign bonds mature in 2018. The DPF, along with operations from other development partners, supports a set of reform measures to stabilize Mongolia’s economy and move it towards a sustainable development path. The reform programs supported by the DPF, developed in close collaboration with the IMF and ADB, seek to: (i) restore debt sustainability; (ii) strengthening the social protection system; and (iii) enhancing competitiveness. The DPF will also help Mongolia mitigate the immediate balance of payments risks by catalyzing successful market‐based refinancing of maturing commercial debt, and create fiscal space by substituting high‐cost, short‐term domestic borrowing with relatively more concessional and long maturity external assistance."

The DPF series is closely aligned with the 2016-2020 National Development Plan (NDP) and is an integral element of the World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Framework (CPF) (FY2016-2019). The second adjustment is the addition of a third and last operation in the series, to broaden its scope and ensure that all reforms are sustainably implemented over time. The initial timeframe of two operations has proved to be too short given the scope and magnitude of all the reforms embedded in the DPF series, especially with the introduction of the fourth pillar proposed above. By adding one more operation, new reforms have been included to assist further the authorities in their effort to implement key policy actions in mobilizing domestic resources (such as the reduction of tax exemptions), in increasing the efficiency and the quality of the education sector (by increasing the teaching time toward targeted poor performing students), and in restoring the financial viability of the energy sector (by ensuring the payment of all arrears). Such extension also contributes to enhance the probability of achieving expected results by consolidating the reforms in strategic sectors such as energy and cocoa, that may face some resistance from vested interests. Lastly, the incorporation of a third operation to the existing series does not represent a radical shift in the WBG strategy since an annual DPF was already programmed during the full period of the CPF (FY2016-2019). The DPF series aims at supporting the Government in its overall effort to promote sustainable and inclusive growth as well as to increase the economy’s resilience to both domestic and external shocks over the next few years. The Government’s strategy has been defined in the recently adopted NDP for the period 2016-2020, which was presented to the international community at the Consultative Group meeting organized in Paris in May 2016. The proposed series selectively focuses on a sub-set of critical challenges linked to fiscal policy and key sectors for inclusive growth: education, energy, and cocoa. These sectors play a critical role in the Government’s strategy as they have all a significant impact on the life of the poorest segments of the population as well as on the redistribution of income across groups. This selectivity was based on the combination of the Government’s priorities, the recent findings of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and other analytical work, and the lessons derived from previous DPF operations in Côte d’Ivoire and in other low-income countries."

The ARPA Transition Fund seeks to gradually increase the resources provided by federal and state governments to ARPA, while decreasing donor-based investments, so that, after a period of 25 years, these governments will finance 100 percent of ARPA costs without any support from the Transition Fund itself or any other donor funds. The second component is the integrated landscape management. This component aims to promote integrated landscape management in the Amazon through complementary strategies that foster the recovery of native vegetation, develop sustainable productive systems, strengthen productive value chains, and implement innovative management arrangements between PAs. This component includes two sub-components: development of sustainable production systems, consolidation of productive value chains, improving the value chain for the recovery of native vegetation, and strengthening the integrated management of protected areas. The third component is the policies for protection and recovery of native vegetation. This component focuses on strengthening the capacity of national and state governments to develop and implement sectoral policies and financial mechanisms to reduce deforestation and promote forest recovery. Finally, the fourth component is the capacity building, cooperation, and project coordination. This component will support activities to improve Brazilian stakeholder implementation capacity and collaboration within and across sectors and to promote effective and efficient project implementation, and at the same time will help advance national compliance with international commitments."

The Chinese government has established a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy to achieve the goals of the 13th 5YP. Central to this strategy are two institutional innovations which have the potential to provide important global lessons to other countries. The first is accurately targeting poverty households and villages through the establishment of the National Poverty Registration Systemin 2013. The NPRS is a census of poor villages and people in China (about 70 million at its inception), which timely tracks characteristics of the poor and their main causes of poverty. The database is closely integrated into the reporting, prioritization, and accountability lines running upward from the village, county, region, and national levels. It provides critical information from the annual assessments of which households or villages have exited poverty, are at risk of falling back into poverty, or face challenges exiting from poverty. It thus plays a key role in both the identification of the remaining poor and the monitoring of programs to eradicate poverty. Secondly, since 2016, China has introduced the concept of decentralization of poverty reduction efforts with the aim to empower county governments to achieve their poverty targets. It consolidates many earmarked poverty reduction funds into a program-based budgeting system tailored to local context. The designated poverty counties have now been put fully in the driver’s seat for achieving poverty reduction goals. Nevertheless, the program development and implementation remains to be a challenge for the county governments, which face human resources capacity constraints. The Program for Results operation (PforR) enhances these institutional the NPRS database, and aligns fiscal inputs with results by introducing improved planning, budgeting and monitoring systems for poverty programs in Guangxi. It also aims to help to improve the monitoring of poverty reduction programs in one of the most impoverished regions of the country. The lessons from adopting these innovations in Guangxi can serve as learning experience to similar complex settings in the rest of the world and will help the WBG in supporting other countries eradicate extreme poverty by 2030."

A hybrid Program for Results (PforR) and Investment Project Financing (IPF) operation is chosen to address the mix of policy actions, investment activity, and technical assistance to achieve the desired outcomes of the Economic opportunities program. The Economic opportunities program will support a subset of the government’s jobs compact program. The activities supported by the PforR constitute the boundary of the program and have been selected based on the World Bank Group’s strengths and ongoing development operations."

The operation is designed to support the implementation of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for the period 2016-2018, known as the ‘Cadre Stratégique pour la Relance Economique et le Développement Durable du Mali’ (Strategic Cadre for Economic Recovery and Durable Development - CREDD). The CREDD, the 2015 Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and the FY16-19 Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Mali are all closely aligned. The PRIGSO operations support the policies defined in the CREDD by fostering inclusive growth and supporting pro-poor (decentralized) transfers and social protection. This is the second operation of a series comprising two single tranche operations. The first credit (p157900) in the amount of US$50 million was approved in May 2017. Previous development policy operation (DPO) series supported efforts to address the twin challenges of fiscal consolidation while also tackling governance problems by focusing on strengthening Public Financial Management (PFM) and Governance. Reforms supported in the past included efforts to improve budget transparency, strengthen fiduciary and establishment of controls, and improve public investment management, as well as actions to reduce opportunities for corruption, accelerate public procurement and build local government financial management capacity. The present series, by contrast, aims to sustain the foundations for inclusive economic growth, decentralization and protection of the most vulnerable. The dialogue on PFM reforms is mainly driven by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with the support of other development partners. This second operation maintains the development objectives of the first operation: (i) fostering inclusive growth; and (ii) supporting pro-poor (decentralized) transfers and social protection while deepening the ongoing reforms to achieve the expected results. The operation supports the first objective through a set of mutually reinforcing real-sector reforms that should lead to increased incomes for poor rural households. Point of departure are reforms that enhance the security of tenure. This is accompanied by measures to enhance the functioning of markets (finance, telecom, rural roads, energy) critical to rural growth. The second objective is operationalized by increasing the coverage and reducing the fragmentation of the social protection system, by improving the provision of agricultural subsidies and by supporting accelerated decentralization. This is an important element of the Peace Agreement as reflected by the commitment to almost double the share of spending by non-central entities (collectivités territoriales) from approximately 16 percent of the budget in 2016 to 30 percent in 2018. As governance remains an area of concern, the Authorities have been notified that good governance is an important prerequisite for the PRIGSO series as maintaining macro-economic stability."

The first pillar continues to focus on strengthening fiscal management. The second pillar aims at enhancing agricultural productivity through value addition and improving power sector’s financial viability. This operation entails two important changes with respect to the previous operation of this DPF series. The first is that a third pillar supporting a more equitable provision of education and health care services has been introduced. The inclusion of a third pillar reflects the results of the Benin systematic country diagnostic approved in January 2018 and the renewed commitment of authorities in this area. The second change in the operation is that it will include both an IDA Credit and an IDA policy-based guarantee (PBG). These two changes do not modify, and rather increase, the rationale for WBG support, which is to support the implementation of the GAP and the program for growth and sustainable development (PC2D). The project is fully anchored in the World Bank Group’s maximizing financing for development (MFD) approach.

The operation is in the amount of US$24 million equivalent, split equally between IDA credit and IDA grant. The DPO program squarely backs the government priorities as expressed in its medium‐term plan ‘Unity, Trust, Creation’, 2018‐2022, unveiled in 2018. The proposed program builds on the previous DPO series, which also aimed to enhance public sector governance and improve the business environment, while adding a new focus on fiscal management, particularly in light of growing macroeconomic imbalances, and the manifest need for coherent macroeconomic policy planning to support medium‐term objectives. The operation will support the country’s endeavors to reduce its vulnerability to climate change risks and natural disasters through expanded internet connectivity, which is a critical foundation for effective mitigation. Thus, it is fully in line with past and planned Bank‐Government strategic objectives in the country, as well as with corporate priorities. The Kyrgyz authorities recognize these challenges and are committed to addressing structural impediments to more sustainable and inclusive growth. The new government, ushered‐in following the elections of October 2017, has adopted a development roadmap for the medium‐term that accords high priority to addressing governance issues in a wide range of areas (from economic management to public services delivery), while also emphasizing the need for coordinated initiatives to leverage growth opportunities in key sectors of the economy, encourage digitalization of the economy, and promote spatially balanced economic development. The plan serves as a vehicle to implement the country’s long-term development vision embodied in Vision 2040. Considering heightened fiscal imbalances, including as a result of pre‐electoral slippages and adverse exogenous developments, the new government has also committed to strengthening fiscal management, an ambition that this operation supports. Building on the government’s reform efforts and strategic priorities, the DPO has three pillars, covering reforms to strengthen macro‐fiscal foundations for growth, enhance transparency and anti‐corruption in the public sector and boost private sector competitiveness. Pillar one aims to help the authorities strengthen fiscal discipline, through measures to increase revenues in the short run, but also to anchor fiscal policy more sustainably in the context of a sound fiscal rule. Pillar two seeks to enhance transparency and anti‐corruption in the public sector, through reforms to strengthen public sector integrity, and improve the value for money of public procurement. Pillar three aims to boost private sector competitiveness, through measures to facilitate trade, improve the business environment, and promote greater digital connectivity. Stronger fiscal management and governance are essential preconditions for private investment and firm growth, which the recently completed Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) identified as the single most important driver of progress on the Twin Goals going forward."

The first pillar, on public financial management, includes actions to strengthen the management of Kiribati’s sovereign wealth fund, improve cash management, and address weaknesses in the public investment cycle, including procurement and asset maintenance. This pillar consolidates and complements measures supported in previous series on the sovereign wealth fund, debt policy and management, and state-owned enterprise governance. Over time and in conjunction with other measures, these actions should contribute to improvements in the quality of public spending. The second pillar, on inclusive growth, includes actions to strengthen governance of fisheries, one of the few sectors with significant potential to drive growth and employment creation in Kiribati. This pillar also includes actions to expand access to safe drinking water and establish a legislative framework for early childhood care and education – basic services that are crucial building blocks for a healthy and educated workforce. This pillar complements measures supported in previous series on fisheries revenue, improving access to electricity for the poor, and telecom sector liberalization and service expansion in the outer islands. As part of the ongoing policy dialogue with the Bank and other budget support donors, the Government of Kiribati (GoK) has published its 2019 Fiscal Strategy (the first time a fiscal strategy has been made public), and the Strategy includes a commitment to no further step changes to salaries in the 2019 budget, and not until the impacts of the 2018 decision have been reviewed. The Kiribati Development Plan 2016–19 (KDP) identifies key priority areas for the medium term, with the overarching vision, Towards a better educated, healthier, more prosperous nation with a higher quality of life. The KDP focuses on six priority areas: (i) human resource development; (ii) economic growth and poverty reduction; (iii) health; (iv) environment; (v) governance; and (vi) infrastructure. The priorities in the KDP have been reinforced and set within a longer-term development strategy in the Kiribati 20-Year Vision 2016-2036 (“KV20”), finalized earlier this year following a series of community consultations. KV20 is structured around four pillars: (i) wealth – natural, human and cultural capital; (ii) peace and security; (iii) infrastructure for development; and (iv) governance. The first pillar of the proposed operation on strengthening public financial management (PFM) with respect to financial and physical assets is closely aligned with the economic growth and poverty reduction priority of the KDP, and with the wealth pillar of KV20. The second pillar of the proposed operation on supporting inclusive growth through fisheries reform and better basic services is closely aligned with the human resource development, economic growth and poverty reduction, health and infrastructure priorities of the KDP, as well as with the wealth and infrastructure for development pillars of KV20."

The PBG not only enables Ukraine to raise capital from a private market transaction, but also helps de-risk Ukraine in attracting additional necessary financing from Eurobonds. Ukraine's access to international capital markets remains constrained due to deteriorating market conditions, as well as macroeconomic vulnerabilities. These risks are mitigated by the strong voice of Ukrainian civil society in advocating for continued reforms and by Ukraine's strong cooperation with the international community.

This project consists of three components. (1) Effective Integration of Environmental Considerations at Appropriate Scales in Territorial and Sector Planning. The lack of up-to-date and accurate information on biodiversity and ecosystem services leads to territorial and municipal land-use planning instruments that do not sufficiently reflect environmental criteria. A need has been identified to improve ecological representation in land use planning, i.e. to ensure the inclusion of variables such as land cover, key ecosystems, protected areas and forest reserves in land-use plans. Subcomponent (1.1) Generation and management of information on biodiversity and ecosystem services for territorial and sector planning. Regional environmental authorities and territorial entities need to manage information with the appropriate specifications on sustainability, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, for its integration into territorial planning and integrated landscape management, at regional and local level.

Strengthening the national and regional system of protected areas (SINAP, SIRAP), including support to the process of declaring a new national protected area, “Savannahs and Wetlands of Arauca”. Subcomponent (2.2) Sustainable Management for Resilient and Connected Productive Landscapes. Seasonal ecosystems such as the savannahs of Arauca and Casanare, and the altillanura savannahs of Vichada, are generally perceived as “vacant” for any type of development or productive intervention, with pressure increasing to transform these ecosystems.

The country, as part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC), is home to 8 of the 200 ecoregions recognizedworldwide, with 21 times more plant species per square kilometer than in Brazil, and a greater number of vertebrate species thanany other country in Central America and the Caribbean. According to the National Strategy for Biodiversity 2018-2050, the NationalProtected Areas System (SINAP) comprises 120 protected areas (PAs), 12 wildlife zones, and a variety of ecosystems, which togetheraccount for 31.8 percent of the country's land surface and 13.5 percent of the country's marine areas. Approximately 12 percent ofthe Panamanian population inhabits forested areas of the country and two-thirds of the country’s forest cover are in indigenouspeoples’ traditional territories, which include both indigenous territory and PAs, comprising some of Panama’s richest naturalresources and cultural diversity. The Panamanian territory plays an important role in the natural connectivity south of the MBC andnorthern South America, as it has played in different geological times. Biodiversity is of paramount importance not only due to theenvironmental good and services it provides, but also because an estimated 45 percent of the global economy is based on biologicalproducts and processes (World Tourism Organization, 2011). Rural inhabitants under clear land planning principles and a propergovernance structure are at the core for the preservation of Panama’s natural capital which is of national and global significance.Growth in world population has led to increased demands for greater supplies of food, causing one of the main drivers for GHGemission, biodiversity loss, and land degradation when unproperly managed. Biodiversity conservation relies on, inter alia,creating the opportunities to reduce the pressure affecting PAs. Better economic opportunities must be created for those ruralinhabitants trapped in poverty, which currently results in the need of expanding the agricultural frontier with unsustainableproductive systems that are fragmenting the ecosystem to improve their livelihoods. This scenario threatens to amplify a viciouscycle over the rural economy that could result in major threats to the SINAP. From 2006 to 2012, a total of 65,250 hectares weredeforested, of which 89 percent (58,309 hectares) were converted to areas for agricultural activities, with cattle farmingaccounting for most (45,542 hectares) of the deforested areas. The balance between forest gains and losses continues to be negativeover the period 2012-2019, with a loss of 56,369 hectares. Recent studies indicate that connectivity for most large terrestrialmammals is low in the Panamanian portion of the MBC, particularly forest in Darien, Donoso-Santa Fe, and La Amistad National Park,leading to habitats fragmentation as a primary driver of wildlife loss (Meyer, et al., 2019). Infrastructure development speciallyto create connectivity between Central and South America may threaten the natural habitats remaining and leave patches of naturalvegetation increasing biodiversity loss. Additionally, mining exploration and exploitation, hydroelectric projects, and the openingof rural roads and pathways are also part of the main drivers of deforestation, forest degradation and natural habitatfragmentation. Complicating the rural development challenge is the fact that Panama’s rural economy is highly exposed to thecombined effects of extreme weather events and climate change. The annual cost of disaster impacts is estimated to range from US$125 to 150 million (0.36 percent to 0.42 percent of GDP), which would have significant effects on long-term economic growth.Extreme weather events - intense storms, floods, and droughts - are negatively and more regularly affecting the livelihoods ofpeople living in lagging regions, predominantly women, Indigenous people and Afro-descendants. Evidence is accumulating that theincreasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events are attributable to climate change, which threatens to underminePanama’s unique biodiversity, the sustainability of agri-food systems, and the ability of the rural families to be food- andnutrition-secure, diversify, and improve their livelihoods (Panama Climate Risk and Adaptation Country profile). Climate changehas, and will continue to, adversely affect biodiversity at the genetic, species and ecosystem level. The majority of ecosystems inthe Americas have already experienced increased mean and extreme temperatures and/or precipitation which have, for example, causedchanges in species distributions and ecosystem boundaries. The main impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and marine species are theshift in their geographic ranges, and changes in seasonal activities, migration patterns and abundances (Bustamante, et al., 2018).The proposed operation aims at building institutional capacity and leveraging the activities that drive the rural economy toultimately improve the management of PAs containing biodiversity of vital importance. Building institutional capacity andcoordination of the public and private stakeholders will be essential for the operation to mainstreaming biodiversity into incomegeneration initiatives and towards a more systematic agenda for the sustainable use of the country’s natural resources. The projectwill promote sustainable and environmentally friendly investments to reduce biodiversity losses, particularly for the pooresthouseholds in the country, mostly located in Indigenous and Afro-descendants territories. As main driver of potential biodiversitylosses, both agriculture and tourism and their linkages will be the main entry points for the operation’s objective to contributeto a sustainable dynamization of Panama’s rural economy. The operation will promote the early engagement with the private sector,local communities and governments as critical partner to embrace and co-finance the proposed approach to maximize the impact of theGlobal Environment Facility (GEF) allocation. The integration of biodiversity with the agricultural and tourisms sectors willcontribute to reduce biodiversity loss giving value to the natural capital and the reinforcement of the natural assets to valuenature will be the focus. The core benefit of the project would be in favor of the protected areas and the conservation of thebiodiversity. The direct beneficiaries will include primarily (i) Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities, family farmers,producer cooperatives, small size entrepreneurs in project areas; and (ii) key public institutions -Ministry of Environment,Ministry of Agricultural Development, and the National Tourism Authority- and their civil servants would also directly benefit fromcapacity building interventions of the project. In addition, indirect beneficiaries will include those benefiting from the improvedbiodiversity management, stronger rural economy and better institutional services. Women and youth will be supported under allcomponents. The project is organized in three components: Component 1 (C1) will support institutional strengthening for land-useplanning and reinforce the skills to promote knowledge management and dissemination for the protection of the country naturalcapital. This will be done by (a) nature-based landscape vision and (b) knowledge for environmental management. The component willfacilitate technical and financial support to activities that integrate biodiversity into the public institutions and strengthennational in these environmental institutions, public policies, partner entities, local governments, and a more active participationof the private sector and communities in the conservation of biodiversity, particularly in the IPs and Afro-descendants territories(inclusive conservation).

In the entire Miombo eco-region, Zambia has the highest diversity of trees and is the centre for endemism for Brachystegia tree species - one of the Miombo woodland’s key species. The miombo woodlands in Zambia are a vast and diverse ecosystem that covers approximately two-thirds of the country's land area. Socioeconomically, miombo woodlands are a vital source of livelihood for rural communities who depend on them for firewood, charcoal, timber, and non-timber forest products such as mushrooms, honey, and medicinal plants. Overall, the forest sector is important to the Zambian economy, essentially because most people depend on the use of natural resources for their survival. Forests are estimated to employ 1.4 million people, and 60% of rural households heavily depend upon the use of natural resources. In addition, miombo woodlands provide grazing lands for livestock and support ecotourism activities such as birdwatching, hiking, and wildlife viewing. Forests provide 80% of the energy needs in the form of firewood and charcoal. They contribute about 4.7% of GDP to the national economy or $957.5 million annually to about 6.3% ($1277 million) when multiplier effects of forest and tourism-related activities on other sectors are considered. However, the miombo woodlands are under pressure due to large-scale clearing of land for commercial agriculture, settlements and infrastructure development, livestock grazing and generally land use change. Also, in places with high population, traditional practices such as slash-and-burn agriculture and livestock grazing are having a negative impact on forests. These practices are leading to deforestation, soil degradation, and loss of biodiversity. Finally, climate change is having an impact on the miombo woodlands, with changes in temperature and rainfall patterns affecting the growth and distribution of tree species. Environmentally, miombo woodlands play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance - they help to regulate the water cycle by capturing and storing rainfall, which supports both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Miombo woodlands also act as carbon sinks, sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and mitigating the effects of climate change. Furthermore, miombo woodlands are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including endemic and threatened species such as the African elephant, African wild dog, and sable antelope. Protecting miombo woodlands and their biodiversity is therefore, essential for the conservation of Zambia's natural heritage, socioeconomic benefits and multiple global environmental benefits.This project will build on lessons from the Transforming Landscapes for Resilience and Development (TRALARD) Project (P164764) ($87.2 million 2019 – 2025 in Luapula, Northern and Muchinga provinces). With a focus on promoting diversified, resilient, sustainable livelihoods and management of community forests and protected areas, TRALARD seeks to improve natural resource management in select districts to support sustainable livelihoods. SMEMZ will be strategically designed to i) catalyze the investments; and ii) scale-up best practices related to transformational approaches to integrated natural resource management from TRALARD while supporting livelihoods of local communities. To catalyze the investments and support scaling up, SMEMZ is proposed to be implemented in Muchinga, Copperbelt and Central provinces which are located in the miombo woodland ecoregion. The Sustainable Management of Ecosystems in Miombo Ecoregions of Zambia (SMEMZ) project is conceived to restore degraded production landscapes, enhance biodiversity conservation, and increase the adaptative capacity of the vulnerable population to cope with climate risks within the Zambian miombo ecoregion using an integrated natural resources management approach. The main objective of the proposed project is to strengthen the climate resilience of the miombo forest and forest-dependent communities in the Copperbelt, Central and Muchinga Provinces of Zambia. This will be achieved through the integration of adaptation considerations in land use planning, implementation of sustainable management practices and the promotion of community-based adaptation. The project includes three interrelated components: i) strengthening the policy and institutional environment for, land rehabilitation, biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation in the Kabwe District; ii) promoting an integrated landscape approach in support of sustainable ecosystem management practices and biodiversity conservation in the project area; iii) enhancing climate change adaptation through community-based natural resource management; and iv) knowledge management."

Afro-descendants correspond to 57 percent of the State population - and they account for most of the economically vulnerable population. The GDP of Rio Grande do Norte corresponds to approximately 1 percent of Brazil’s national GDP. Rio Grande do Norte covers an area of 52,810km² (815.53 km² urbanized), and is the third smallest compared to the nine states in the Northeast region, Brazil's poorest. Most of the state (93 percent) lies within the Sertão, the semi-arid region of the NEB which is disproportionately prone to climate change effects. Road transport is key for Rio Grande do Norte logistics, but the sustainability of its assets is at risk due to poor maintenance and safety and climate resilience challenges. RN is traversed by 1,480 kilometers (km) of federal roadways and 4,540 km of state roads—of which 3,464 are paved, which are key for State logistics. The first phase of the Project (P126452) has implemented 274 km of State roads, but due to a lack of resources, the state still has significant physical bottlenecks in its road system – 24,3 percent of the State Road network is in bad condition, and 40.2 percent in regular – showcasing its challenges to maintain the road network, with no experience in implementing performance-based contracts (PBCs). Additionally, low capacity in the Government to act towards climate resilience compounds the emergency costs for roads in rainy years such as 2023-2024. RN roads continue to lack adequate safe road designs – especially in urban settlements – and maintenance of road infrastructure. According to data from the Ministry of Health, between 2019 and 2021, road traffic fatalities have remained stable in RN, with 392 traffic-related deaths in 2022 (11.9 fatalities per 100k inhabitants). While agricultural production in RN only contributes 3.4 percent to the state’s overall GDP, it is still a driving force in the labor market, accounting for one-third of the state’s labor force. Moreover, there is an urgent need for an upgrade in farm-to-market infrastructure to ensure better commercial access, particularly around the key production centers. According to the 2017 Census, there were 50,680 family farms, representing 80 percent of the 63,350 farms statewide. Past surveys showed less than two percent of family farmers were members of agricultural cooperatives, 23 percent were members of associations, 46 percent were affiliated with the Rural Workers Unions (STRs), and almost 30 percent did not engage in any kind of collective organization. Cooperatives of family farmers face difficulties with obtaining Federal Government Food Safety certification (SIF/MAPA), a significant barrier for accessing markets. Whilst these barriers are being slowly overcome, rural market access is impeded during the wet season when roads become impassable. As experience from the previous project shows, better-quality road pavement leads to agricultural sales increase, as this has been clearly demonstrated by the milk and fruit sectors.Tourism activity accounts for 8 percent of Rio Grande do Norte’s GDP and contributes to over 100 thousand formal jobs. Between 2002 and 2020, the share of value added from services to the state’s economy – tourism included – grew from 66 percent to 77 percent. However, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the State lost a significant number of incoming international flights which are yet to resume, reducing foreign currency income. Tourism in the state continues to suffer from a lack of diversification; over 90 percent of visitors during peak seasons visit or plan to visit beaches – benefitting larger companies rather than community-based tourism, while only 14 percent visit or plan to visit inland cities. The proposed Project aims at developing the agriculture and tourism sectors of five key hubs for the economy of the state, while improving transport access with a safer, climate resilient, and sustainable road asset management strategy. Those five hubs have been selected based on the findings of a study commissioned by the state during implementation of Phase 1, which considered, inter alia: volumes of farm credit for capital expenditures and fixed costs; federal fiscal incentives and state fiscal incentives for industrial development given since 2003, linkages with road infrastructure, presence of traditional communities and rural settlements, and market sales potential, including for exports. The five hubs are: (i) Costa Branca region, where there is cluster of fruit cooperatives, (ii) Sertão region, where there is a cluster of cotton cooperatives; (iii) Serido region, where cheese production by women groups (cheese making/queijeiras) predominate, (iv) “Rota do Frio”, where honey production is being developed, and (v) Costa Mar, where animal protein is the key livestock/agricultural output. In doing so, the project will invest in family farming resilience (climate adaptation/mitigation, productivity, and marketing of products) and in an enabling a better business environment for the cooperatives and tourism organizations in these regions to flourish. Crucially, there will be a significant investment in safe and resilient access to road infrastructure to ensure full access to markets and complement the sector-specific interventions.COMPONENT 1 – Access to markets and improved climate resilience of family farmersSub-component 1.1 - Linking family farmers to markets Sub-component 1.2 - Strengthening family farming institutions and systemsSub-component 1.3 - Strengthening the enabling environment for family farming and sustainable community-based tourism market development COMPONENT 2 – Improving sustainable, safe, and resilient access to transport in RNSub-component 2.1: Proactive maintenance CREMA-DBM: Long-term performance-based safe and resilient road management contracts for state road corridorsSub-component 2.2 -State Infrastructure improvement using Public-Private PartnershipsSub-component 2.3 Institutional strengthening, covering three sets of activities: proactive, safe, and resilient road asset management; green mobility and logistics; and social inclusion and genderCOMPONENT 3 - Project Management and Institutional Strengthening"

Thus, the program seeks to: (i) strengthen intersectoral collaboration to better align investments in forest landscapes, (ii) reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the land sector and improve forest livelihoods through the promotion of activities to conserve and sustainably use and restore forest landscapes, (iii) maintain and enhance Mexico’s capacity to monitor and report GHG emissions. By achieving the Program objectives, the GoM will enhance its capacity to access new sources of climate finance.Mexico’s Emissions Reduction Program will adopt a programmatic approach beginning with interventions in the LULUCF sector and aiming to transitioning a potential second phase to emissions reductions from the AFOLU sector. This ESRS focuses on the first phase. A potential second phase which would be prepared separately will require a stand alone E&S assessment depending on program activities under this second phase.The ERP is designed in two components: Component 1: Emission Reductions payment distributed in accordance with agreed Benefit Sharing Plan (BSP): Subcomponent 1.a.: Payment for ERCs and Subcomponent 1.b.: Distribution of Emission Reductions payments as per an agreed BSP. Component 2: Program’s Operating and Coordination Costs. Activities through this component will better target Program measures, maintain program operation, enhance GHG inventory data, improve interagency collaboration, and mainstream gender.The Program measures/activities that will generate the Emission Reductions will be financed by CONAFOR and implemented through its public incentive programs."
