The delivery of the ERs according to the delivery schedule agreed upon in the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) is the results indicator that is being monitored by the World Bank over the ERPA duration.<br />
 <br />
 2. The project has the following specifictechnical objectives: (a) Agriculture Land Management including Agroforestry: to increase food production and household income by expanding legume-based agroforestry systems with demonstrated higher sustainable crop yields, and production of important firewood, materials and tradable carbon compared to thebaseline of traditional smallholder agriculture; (b) Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD): More specifically the Project will promote sustainable climate-smart agricultural practices in selected chiefdoms in the Eastern Province of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ). The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices will increase small-holder farmer crop yield, farmer income and welfare, reduce uncontrolled forest loss and degradation, which would be supported inthe short term by carbon revenues received from a significant increase in bio-carbon sequestration in agricultural areas and avoided emissions in forested areas. 
 

  To protect and expand areas under natural forest and conserve biodiversity through the intensification of food production on existing farm plots by adoption of legume-based agroforestry with in-built firewood production and avoidance of fallows, which will replace the need for further forest clearing as part of slash and burn agriculture, firewood and charcoal production. The decisions on land delineation for specific management purposes rest with the chiefs in consultation with the communities. Currently the challenge is one where allocation of forest areas for agricultural purposes to communities is made by the chief, and as a result the forested areas within the chiefdom are shrinking over time. Several chiefdoms have recognized the problemand are willing to set aside forest areas within chiefdoms for conservation use known as community conservation areas (CCAs). The interventions in CCAs will include land use planning, and preparation forest management plans by communities for managing conservation areas through implementing practices that will ensure that the forest areas are sustained.

The $2million medium-size project (MSP) from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Land Degradation focal area will contribute to increase the climate resilience of Moldova's forest and pasture lands through restoration of degraded lands at community and village level. 
 

 GEF financing will support specificaly afforestation and rehabilitation of forest belts and degraded pastures (LD-1 Program 1) and preparation of integrated and participatory forest/pasture management plans for selected LPAs (LD-3 Program 4). The project will support integrated participatory forest and pasture management planning at the Local Public Authority (LPA) level, as well as investments in afforestation and rehabilitation of community lands and pastures in priority raions (districts) in the central and south regions that are considered to be more vunerable to climate change. The grant will contribute to finance LPA-level landscape mapping (i.e. land use “master plans”) and 10-year operational management plans for approximately 29,000 ha of forest land and pastures that aim at more efficient and sustainable use of these resources. Eligibility criteria for participating LPAs include, among others: willingness to participate, capacity and opportunity for collaboration with neighboring LPAs, and availability of suitable land. Investments in selected LPAs will include restoring approximately 1,000 ha of degraded pastures and 1,500 ha of other degraded communal land, as well as establishing and restoring 1,600 ha of agricultural or riparian shelterbelts. The planning process will be undertaken jointly by ICAS and the LPAs. Technical field work will be contracted to the State Forest Enterprises (SFEs) and/or private sector on a competitive basis.
 

 Improved forest and pasture management practices will provide multiple benefits: improved livelihoods for rural population, carbon sequestration and prevention of further degradation. Without additional grant financing the area covered by afforestation and rehabilitation of forest belts and degraded pastures and the related demonstration effect and uptake of improved land management practices would be significantly reduced. Additionally, increased use of native oak species will replace the use of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), which is an introduced species currently widely used in Moldova. Without additional GEF support it is likely that dominance of fast growing exotic species would continue.",,,https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P163720,"June 9, 2017","June 9, 2017",,"September 30, 2023",BANK APPROVED,O,,,,,2000000.0,,,,,,,,"February 6, 2024"
